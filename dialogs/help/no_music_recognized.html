			<p>In most cases this means the site has changed somehow. The change does not have to be visible to user, but means a lot to the extension.</p>
			<p>The connector code for this specific site needs to be updated. You can navigate to <a href="https://github.com/david-sabata/web-scrobbler/issues" target="_blank">list of issues</a> and see if this site is already reported. If it is not, you can submit a new issue describing what's wrong, what's expected behaviour and what's happening instead.</p>
