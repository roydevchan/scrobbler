			<h4>What are these v2 connectors?</h4>
			<br>
			<p>It's a new format for connectors - definitions for where to look for music on a website.</p>
			<p>V2 format allows us to do much more with the track. First thing you'll notice are artist/album thumbnails in notifications. Also time before we scrobble a track is the time you <em>really</em> listen to it. That means a paused track will not scrobble anymore. You can now re-play tracks by jumping from their end to start and they will be scrobbled again. And that's not all. There will be more features coming for v2 connectors in the future.</p>
			<p>If you're a developer you can add a new v2 connector yourself. It's as easy as writing 5 lines of code. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/david-sabata/web-scrobbler/tree/master/connectors/v2" target="_blank">connectors already made</a>.</p>
