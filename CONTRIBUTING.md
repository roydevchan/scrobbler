### Coding conventions
We use a number of linters to verify the source code. Please ensure before committing the changes they meet our requirements by running grunt lint. If you're not familiar with Grunt, please read this article.

We also use EditorConfig, which helps to keep code in the same code style in different code editors and IDEs. If you haven't use EditorConfig before, you can visit EditorConfig website for further information.
