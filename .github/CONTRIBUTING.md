First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

### Did you find a bug?
* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under issues.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible.

Please read [this page][1] to understand how to get the extension logs.  
If you don't know how to report bugs effectively, please use [this article][2] as a guideline.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds new functionality?
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

It's also worth reading [how to write][3] good commit messages.

#### Coding conventions
We use a number of linters to verify the source code. Please ensure before committing the changes they meet our requirements by running `grunt lint`. If you're not familiar with Grunt, please read [this article][4].

We also use EditorConfig, which helps to keep code in the same code style in different code editors and IDEs. If you haven't use EditorConfig before, you can visit [EditorConfig website][5] for further information.
